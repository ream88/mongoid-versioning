# mongoid-versioning ![Build](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=mongoid6)

**Important:** This gem is an extraction of [Mongoid::Versioning](http://mongoid.github.io/en/mongoid/docs/extras.html#versioning) from the official [mongoid](http://mongoid.org) gem.
Since Mongoid::Versioning was removed in the `4.0.0` release of Mongoid, this gem re-enables the functionality of versioned documents.

**Please submit only bug and security fixes**. Neither I will accept new features nor changes to existing APIs. Please consider forking the project if you want new features to appear! :)

---

Mongoid supports simple versioning through inclusion of the `Mongoid::Versioning` module. Including this module will create a versions embedded relation on the document that it will append to on each save. It will also update the version number on the document, which is an integer.

## Installation

### Mongoid/Ruby compatibility

This fork has additional changes to support the following mongoid/ruby versions:

|                 | branch                                                                            | mongoid-paranoid support | Tested ruby version(s) | Build |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| mongoid <5      | [master](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/tree/master)     | Yes                      | 2.5, 2.6               | ![Build](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=master) |
| mongoid 6       | [mongoid6](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/tree/mongoid6) | No                       | 2.7                    | ![Build](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=mongoid6) |
| mongoid >= 7.0  | [mongoid7](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/tree/mongoid7) | No                       | 2.7                    | ![Build](https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=mongoid7) |

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-versioning', git: 'https://github.com/fullhealthmedical/mongoid-versioning', branch: 'master'
```

## Usage

```ruby
class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Versioning
end
```

You can also set a `max_versions` setting, and Mongoid will only keep the max most recent versions.

```ruby
class Person
  include Mongoid::Document
  include Mongoid::Versioning

  # keep at most 5 versions of a record
  max_versions 5
end
```

You may skip versioning at any point in time by wrapping the persistence call in a `versionless` block.

```ruby
person.versionless do |doc|
  doc.update_attributes(name: "Theodore")
end
```
